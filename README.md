# Haunted-Escape-Room
Interactive puzzle-based escape room game with a haunted storyline, built to showcase logic, game flow, and problem-solving skills.

Haunted Escape Room is an interactive, story-driven escape room game that challenges players to solve puzzles, uncover hidden clues, and escape a haunted environment before time runs out. The project focuses on logical thinking, user interaction, and immersive gameplay mechanics.

The game is designed with a modular structure, making it easy to add new rooms, puzzles, or story elements. Each challenge requires problem-solving skills and attention to detail, encouraging players to think critically while progressing through the haunted storyline.

This project was built to strengthen my programming skills and demonstrate concepts such as game logic, conditional flows, state management, and user input handling. It also reflects my interest in creating engaging, interactive applications with a strong narrative element.
